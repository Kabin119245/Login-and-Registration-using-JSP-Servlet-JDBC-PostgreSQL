"Login-and-Registration-using-JSP-Servlet-JDBC-PostgreSQL" is a backend-focused project aimed at providing a  authentication system using Java technologies. Leveraging JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and PostgreSQL, this project offers functionalities for user registration and login.

The "index.jsp" page serves as the initial landing page for the application, currently under development. It will be designed to seamlessly guide users through the registration and login processes, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Key features of the project include:

1. User Registration:
  Users can create new accounts by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password. The registration process will securely store user data in the PostgreSQL database.

2. User Authentication:
   Registered users can securely log in to their accounts using their credentials. The system will verify the user's input against the stored data in the database.

3. Database Management with JDBC: J
   DBC (Java Database Connectivity) is utilized for seamless interaction with the PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

4. Servlets for Backend Logic:
   Servlets handle the backend logic of the application, processing user requests, validating inputs, and interacting with the database as needed.
